## Documentation

RapidRepo is a comprehensive repository pattern implementation designed to streamline data access and manipulation in .NET applications. It leverages Entity Framework Core to provide a robust and flexible data access layer, ensuring that common data operations are handled efficiently and consistently.

### Purpose

The purpose of RapidRepo is to simplify data access and manipulation in .NET applications by providing a repository pattern implementation. It aims to offer a robust and flexible data access layer using Entity Framework Core.

### Features

- **Streamlined data access and manipulation**: Provides methods and abstractions that simplify common data operations in .NET applications.
- **Repository pattern implementation**: Separates data access logic from business logic, offering a structured way to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- **Leveraging Entity Framework Core**: Uses a popular ORM framework to map database tables to .NET objects, simplifying database operations with object-oriented programming techniques.
- **Efficient and consistent data operations**: Optimizes queries and data retrieval to minimize latency and improve performance, ensuring atomic and reliable data manipulation.

### Usage

To use RapidRepo in your .NET application:

1. Install the RapidRepo NuGet package.
2. Configure the database connection string in your application's configuration file.
3. Create a repository class that inherits from the `BaseRepository` class provided by RapidRepo.
4. Implement any additional custom repository methods as needed.
5. Use the repository methods to perform data access and manipulation operations in your application.
